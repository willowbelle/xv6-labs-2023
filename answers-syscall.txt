usertrap in kernel/trap.c:67 call the syscall.

p->trapframe->a7 = 0x7,a7 register is used to store syscall num,\
in this example it loaded SYS_exec syscall num(0x07).


previous mode is user mode,this can be konwn by the sstatus bits.

the kernel is pancing at "lw ar,0(zero)",register a3 is corresponding to the variable num.

In my opinion,the reason is address 0 isn't mapped.And scause value(0xd,usually represents load page fault) confirmed this.

initcode process is running when the kernel panic,its pid is 1.
